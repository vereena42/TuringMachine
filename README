Simple Turing Machine simulator. Name of the input file should be given as an argument.

Blank symbol is '-'.
Tape alphabet is [a-z] + [A-Z] + [0-9] + '-'.
State can be any string.
Moves are {L (left),R (right), S (stay)}.

Input should be in the form:

In the first line should be a start state.
In the second line should be end states (seperate by spaces).
In next lines should be instructions of transition function (machine state, symbol under the head, new machine state, new symbol, move).
After one empty line there should be string describing a tape.

Machine starts on the first symbol of a tape.

Example of an input:
A
B
A 1 A 0 R
A 0 A 1 R
A - B - S
